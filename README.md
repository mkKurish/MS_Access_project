# PC assembler

>### You should put the folder "img" and the file "pc assembler.accdb" to the same path to provide proper functioning

#### (That's because all project's links to the images point to images in directory `CurrentProject.Path + "\img`)

```
Image1.Picture = (CurrentProject.Path + "\img\bp\" & creator & " " & model & ".jpg")
```
