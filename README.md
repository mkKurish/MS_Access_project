# PC assembler

>### You should put the folder "img" and the file "pc assembler.accdb" to the path **"D:\PROJECT"** to provide proper functioning

#### (That's because all project's links to the images are static and point to images in directory "D:\PROJECT\img")

```
Image1.Picture = ("D:\PROJECT\img\bp\" & creator & " " & model & ".jpg")
```
